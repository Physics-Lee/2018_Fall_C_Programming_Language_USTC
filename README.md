This repository is here to memorize my first programming in 2018 FA. It contains several small homework and 3 big homework.



Before entering college, the only thing I knew is how to insert a graph to Microsoft Word or how to do sorting in Microsoft Excel. I came to USTC in 2018-09 and studied C in 2018 FA. My teacher was Weibing Gu (顾为冰). Thank her a lot.
