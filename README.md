This repository is here to memorize my first programming in 2018 FA. It contains several small homework and 3 big homework.

The most fantastic program is `print_all_Chinese_character.cpp`, I am sure you will have fun in running it.

You can run these codes by Dev-C++ , VS or VS code. 

I had several drawbacks in 2018 FA, including

* Using Chinese pinyin instead of English to name a variable or function.
* Not using camel case or snake case.
* lacking comments.
* Using Chinese character in comments and print, which might lead to messy code.



Before entering college, the only thing I knew is how to insert a graph to Microsoft Word or how to do sorting in Microsoft Excel. I came to USTC in 2018-09 and studied C in 2018 FA. My teacher was Weibing Gu (顾为兵) and we usually called her 'Grandma Gu'. Thank her a lot for bringing me into the gate of programming.
